	<h2 id="Export">Export</h2>
	<p>To export a model or parts of a model select the elements to be
		exported in the Capella Project Explorer, open the context menu and
		select “Pivot XML -&gt; Export”.</p>
	<p>This will open a file dialog which allows choosing the
		destination file for the export. Press OK in the file dialog to
		continue the export. After the export completes, a status dialog shows
		the elements that have been excluded from the export because they do
		not form part of the Capella simplified metamodel.</p>
	<p>
		<img border="0" src="Images/XMLPivot_Export.png" />
	</p>
	<p>It is possible to hide all trace elements from the dialog by
		deselecting the checkbox “Show abstract trace elements”. The elements
		in this list are also shown in the Information view in order to
		conserve the report even after the dialog is closed. After closing the
		dialog, the export tool offers to open the exported xml file in an
		editor.</p>
	<p>After confirmation, a basic editor allows to inspect the export
		result:</p>
	<p>
		<img border="0" src="Images/XMLPivot_Export_Result.png" />
	</p>
	<p>It is also possible to modify the export result via the
		Properties View. If the Properties View is not open, you can open it
		by selecting “Show Properties View” in the context menu of any element
		in the Editor.</p>
	<h2 id="Command-line_Export">Command-line Export</h2>
	<p>It is possible to export a Capella model with the Capella
		headless command-line application. The command to run an export in
		headless mode is:</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote> eclipse.exe -consoleLog -application
			org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core -appid xmlpivot.export
			-filePath &lt;Path&gt; </blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>The filePath argument may either be a relative or an absolute
		path. If it is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the
		workspace. To specify an explicit workspace, you can use an additional
		parameter:</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote> eclipse.exe –data &lt;Path to Workspace&gt; -consoleLog
			-application org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core -appid
			xmlpivot.export -filePath &lt;Path&gt; </blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote> eclipse.exe -consoleLog -application
			org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core -appid xmlpivot.export
			-filePath C:/EOLE_AF/EOLE_AF.melodymodeller</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote> eclipse.exe -consoleLog -application
		org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core -appid xmlpivot.export
		-filePath EOLE_AF/EOLE_AF.melodymodeller </blockquote>
	</p>
	<h2 id="The_Simplified_Capella_Metamodel_Project">The Simplified
		Capella Metamodel Project</h2>
	<p>Note that the export also creates an additional project
		“Simplified Capella Metamodel” in the workspace. This project will
		contain .ecore (Similar to XML Schema) definitions of the simplified
		Capella Metamodel. This project should not be deleted, as it is
		required to open the exported model in the basic editor, or any other
		EMF based tool that has to load the exported model. To share your
		exported model with others, always share the “Simplified Capella
		Metamodel” project too.</p>
	<h2 id="Import_as_New_Project">New Capella Project From XML Pivot</h2>
	<p>It is possible to initialize a new Capella project from a
		simplified Capella model: Open the Capella Project explorer context
		menu and select “New -&gt; Capella Project from XML Pivot”. This will
		open the Capella Project Wizard with an additional step that allows
		selecting the source .xml file:</p>
	<p>
		<img border="0" src="Images/XMLPivot_Import_Wizard.png" />
	</p>
	<p>
		<blockquote>TIP: IF THE SOURCE .XML FILE IS INSIDE THE CAPELLA WORKSPACE,
			YOU CAN SELECT THE .XML FILE AND THEN OPEN THE WIZARD. THIS WILL
			AUTOMATICALLY SET THE LOCATION FIELD TO THE PATH OF THE PREVIOUSLY
			SELECTED FILE.</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>After filling out the remaining steps of the Capella Project
		Wizard click “Finish” to create the project.</p>
	<h2 id="Merge">Merge With Existing Capella Project</h2>
	<p>It is possible to import a simplified Capella model and merge it
		directly into an existing Capella project. To merge such a model,
		select its .xml file in the Capella Project Explorer and select “Pivot
		XML -&gt; Merge with existing Capella Project”. These commands will
		import the source .xml file and open the interactive Capella
		Diff/Merge editor.</p>
	<h2 id="Viewpoint_Addon_Support">Viewpoint Addon Support</h2>
	<p>The XMLPivot tool comes with automatic support for metamodel
		extensions provided through viewpoint addons. During export, all
		required external viewpoint metamodels are transformed automatically
		into a corresponding meta model that is compatible with the simplified
		Capella meta model. The .ecore file for the simplified viewpoint meta
		model is then stored inside the “Simplified Capella Metamodel”
		project, alongside the simplified Capella meta model .ecore files.</p>
